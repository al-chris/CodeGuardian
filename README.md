### Sample API Requests

#### Start a new scan

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/scan" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"repository_url": "https://github.com/username/repo", "branch": "main"}'
```

#### Get scan results

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/scan/your-scan-id"
```

## Architecture

CodeGuardian follows a modular architecture:

1. **API Layer**: FastAPI-based REST API
2. **Core Scanner**: Code analysis engine with pattern matching and AST parsing
3. **ML Pipeline**: TensorFlow and scikit-learn based ML models
4. **Fix Generator**: Intelligent code fix suggestion system
5. **Dashboard**: Data visualization and metrics tracking

## ML Models

The system utilizes several machine learning models:

1. **Vulnerability Classifier**: Categorizes vulnerabilities by type and severity
2. **Priority Predictor**: Determines which issues need immediate attention
3. **Code Fix Generator**: Suggests fixes based on vulnerability patterns

## How It Demonstrates Advanced Skills

- **Machine Learning**: Custom ML models for code analysis
- **Security Expertise**: Demonstrates understanding of code vulnerabilities
- **Scalable System Design**: Modular architecture that can handle large codebases
- **API Design**: Well-structured RESTful API
